### 🛠️ Side Projects

In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects. One of my current endeavors is [**Update Me**](https://github.com/anfreire/updateMe-Mobile/), a mobile app that helps users keep track of the latest versions of their favorite modded apps. This project showcases my full-stack development skills:

This architecture allows for a responsive user interface, efficient device-level operations, and a flexible, self-hosted backend solution.
